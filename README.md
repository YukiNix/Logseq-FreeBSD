## Use Logseq on FreeBSD?

**ATTENTION: This repo has only been tested on XFCE4 and rl9(Rocky Linux 9) linux userland. The runtime dependencies might not be fully found and listed since my computer is too old and slow to run `poudriere`.**

If you find anything wrong, feel free to open a PR(Push Request) or mail me directly. There is a big list of `ldd` output follow this guide, it might be very useful. 

For convinience, I denote [FreeBSD HandBook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/) as "the Handbook", which is the most handfull guide for me.

For developers, it is **highly** recommand to this ports by [jails](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Jails) and [poudriere](https://wiki.freebsd.org/VladimirKrstulja/Guides/Poudriere). For more details, please follow the HandBook chapter [17.Jails and Containers](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/) and [FreeBSD Porter's Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/) chapter [10.7.poudrier](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/testing/#testing-poudriere).


#### 1. Graphical Interface

To launch Logseq on FreeBSD, you need a graphical interface. **This step is highly depends on the machine and your mind.** 

If you do not known how to do it, please follow the Handbook chapters [5.X11](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/x11/), [6.wayland](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/wayland/) and [8.Desktop Enviroments](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/desktop/).

#### 2. Linux Binary Compatibility

Linux Binary Compatibility is also needed at present time. The details can be found in the Handbook chapter [12.Linux Binary Compatibility](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/).

Here is a brief summarize, root privilege might be needed.
 
To enable the [Linux ABI](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=linux&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+14.2-RELEASE+and+Ports&arch=default&format=html) at boot time:
`sysrc linux_enable="YES"`

Once enabled, it can be started without rebooting by: `service linux start`

I recommend to use Rocky Linux 9 userland (which is the newest userland in [pkg](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pkg)): `pkg install linux_base-rl9` 

The userland of Debian and Cenos 7 should also work, but have not been tested. For details, please follow the Handbook chapter [12.3.Linux userlands](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/#linux-userlands).

The chapter [12.4.Advanced topics](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/#linuxemu-advanced) is highly recommand if you have something wrong when launch Logseq on FreeBSD.
